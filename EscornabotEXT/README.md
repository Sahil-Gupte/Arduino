# Escornabot-EXTlib

> [**Escornabot EXT**](https://ext.escornabot.org/) (codename *"Kanoi"*) is an evolution of the [Escornabot](https://github.com/escornabot) project, a free and open source software and hardware project originally created by [Tucho Méndez](https://github.com/procastino), [Rafa Couto](https://github.com/rafacouto) and [me](https://gitlab.com/xoan), that aims to bring robotics and programming to children.

> The purpose of this evolution is to make it more flexible and versatile.

This repository contains all the source code and documentation of the Escornabot EXT library and firmware for the Arduino platform.

## Documentation
